# Automatically deploy acme-client

# Note that this role does not support generating certificates that need to be
# shared across machines.  It can only generate a certificate that will be used
# on a single machine.  If you try to run this role to generate a shared
# certificate, all but the last one generated will be invalid, and if you
# generate more than three, LetsEncrypt will throttle you.
